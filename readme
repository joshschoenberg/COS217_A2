------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.
"None"

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?
It took an incredibly long time for me to finish, and it was particular-
ly fustrating to not be allowed to have help on Str_search, which took a
large majority of the time. Overall, it  was a  fun  assignment, though, 
and contibuted to a good way of COS thinking. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?
I am aware that my Str_search might not be the most efficient, and that 
it is not the most elegant. However, after spending probably close to 
15 hours just on this function, I thought that my solution would 
suffice, and that it, at least, is not too inefficient.

What warnings does splint generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."
None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."
For all of the following warnings:
    stra.c: line 100: low priority: 
    This area is deeply nested at level 5, consider refactoring
 
    stra.c: line 126: low priority: 
    This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring
 
    stra.c: line 110: low priority: 
    This area is deeply nested at level 7, consider refactoring
 
    stra.c: line 116: low priority: 
    This area is deeply nested at level 6, consider refactoring
These warnings are correct that there are many layers of nesting; 
however, when developing my code (and after spending a ridiculous 
amount of time on this function), this was the most elegant solution I 
could find. In addition, this low-priority warning does not seem to 
upsetting to me, since different levels of nesting can sometimes be 
necessary. 

    stra.c: line 83: low priority: 
    A loop should consist of fewer than 35 lines;
    this loop consists of 52 lines; consider refactoring
This warning, similarly, does not seem to be a big issueâ€”it is also 
necessary to have a longer loop here.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write

The warnings on strp.c are the same as the ones on stra.c, and I would
give the same disagreement as the ones I gave for stra.c.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."
None.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."
None.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."
None.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.
It is not possible. The only thing that you are passing into Str_copy 
and Str_concat is a pointer to the first item in the destination. 
This will be 8 bytes no matter, so this does not give you any 
information on the size of the memory of the destination, in general. 
Thus, you cannot know the size of the destination for Str_copy or
Str_concat, and you therefore will not be able to verify that the 
destination memory area is big enough.
